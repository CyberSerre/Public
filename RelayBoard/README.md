# RelayBoard

Hi Everyone,

this github is a work in progress. I created it to share a base code to use our Relay board with the MQTT protocole. This device and code work fine for the last 6 months in our office with the esp-idf version. We wanted to keep the code simple. We know we did some bad thing but we will create another example with a better code in the future.
Feel free to use it or submit a pull request:)
