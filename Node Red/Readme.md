Welcome to the  Node Red example folder. ##

We created this folder to help you to use our  product. ##
In each example, you will have the minimal recommanded configuration.

For all example, we use :
    -Node Red
        (https://github.com/node-red/node-red
    
    -MQTT broker
        we are using  Mosquitto broker (https://mosquitto.org/)

We also use the MQTT explorer tool to monitor all message published during the  devellopement stage (http://mqtt-explorer.com/)
